Everyone just use a notepad to tell others what you have changed in the code so it would be better for everyone to understand.
Also tell me it we want to add system("CLS") to clearthe screen whenever something new comes up.

Check these changes and kindly tell if there is any loophole in the program.

1. I have defined 'size' for the size of array for better accesibilty 
2. Created the .csv file for inventory
3. Created the log out option
4. Created inventory function
5.Improved the password now backspace is acceptable and password is stored once enter is hit by the user.
6. I have debugged the inventory function adn also did the same for log out option(now it is working).



Things to remember while coding

1. If we are using switch then remember to put it a default case also stating that entered choice is inocrrect and if the
   user puts incorrect value then he should again see the choice and be asked to take his choice.(use do while)
2. If we are putting the variable names as c,a,ch then infront of those variable add a comment telling what those variables are meant to do.
   This will help in better understanding of the code.
3. We should remember to put the condition if none of the option is selected like printf("Entered Wrong Choice"); and put this in do while 
   just like told above.
4. Put printf("Entered Wrong Choice"); in red colour
5. During debugging, try to put all possible condition a user can put so as to make the program more durable and efficient.
