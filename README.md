# Description
It is a shopping store management software.The software is made to be operated by both the customer and the administrator. The whole program has been modulated into a number of functions and dynamic memory allocation has been used to make it efficient and user friendly. <br/>
The .csv files are automatically updated to keep the stocks ,customer details and bill records up to date.

This software has been created through **C**.

## Structs Defined

### 1. typedef struct node
This stores the item and contains attributes for the item.


### 2. typedef struct date
This stores the date. Each structure contains date, month, year. 


### 3. typedef struct customer

### 4. typedef struct bill_det
This stores information of each invoice generated.


### 5. typedef struct bill
Stores the details of the final bill of the current customer.



## Objective

### [Project](https://github.com/DS-Project-1-0/Supermarket-Software/blob/master/Project.h)
This is a header file that contains the definition of each struct and declaration of every function used in the software.<br />

### [Project file](https://github.com/DS-Project-1-0/Supermarket-Software/blob/master/Project%20file.c)
This initializes the software and presents the dashboard and asks whether the user is an admin or customer.

### [Functions](https://github.com/DS-Project-1-0/Supermarket-Software/blob/master/Functions.c)
This is the main class of the Checkers Game where the whole game takes place updating the board, moving pieces, and making all the algorithm-based decisions.

**<ins>Member Functions</ins>**
**1.	Logic (int algoNum)**<br />

Constructor to initialize the board, maintain what functions to be called whenever a piece is moved or <br />

selected, display appropriate messages after each move is played.

**2.	public chooseAlgo(int algo, char[][] game, int depth, String player)**<br />

Function defined so as to switch between the two algorithms.
